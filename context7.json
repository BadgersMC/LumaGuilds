  "rules": [
    "This plugin uses hexagonal/clean architecture with distinct layers: domain, application, infrastructure, and interaction",
    "Domain entities should never depend on external frameworks - they contain pure business logic",
    "Application actions are the primary use cases - inject dependencies via constructor",
    "All database operations go through repository interfaces defined in application layer",
    "Use dependency injection (Koin) for wiring components - see di package",
    "Claims are anchored by Bell blocks in the Minecraft world",
    "All player interactions go through the interaction layer (commands, menus, listeners)",
    "Use Result sealed classes to handle action outcomes - never throw exceptions for business logic failures",
    "Guilds and Claims are separate concepts - Claims can be converted to guild ownership",
    "Always check permissions before allowing claim modifications",
    "Use Position3D for world coordinates and Position2D for area definitions"
