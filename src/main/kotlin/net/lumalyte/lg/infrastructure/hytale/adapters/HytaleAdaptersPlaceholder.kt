/**
 * PLACEHOLDER FILE
 *
 * The adapters in this package are placeholders until the Hytale server API is fully explored.
 * Once Hytale Early Access launches and we can test against a running server, these will be
 * implemented properly.
 *
 * Current Status:
 * - HytalePlayerAdapter: References correct ECS concepts but needs API verification
 * - HytaleItemAdapter: Needs actual Hytale ItemStack API exploration
 * - HytalePositionAdapter: Transform and Vec3d need verification
 * - HytaleEventAdapter: Event system structure needs verification
 * - HytaleInventoryAdapter: ItemContainer API needs exploration
 *
 * Next Steps:
 * 1. Launch Hytale server when available
 * 2. Decompile and study actual API (JD-GUI/Fernflower)
 * 3. Update adapters with correct imports and method calls
 * 4. Test each adapter individually
 * 5. Write integration tests
 *
 * The architecture is sound - we just need the actual API details.
